Quantum Inventions Assignment-

The BDD framework is intented to test OneMap application.

feature files and Steps-
As it is a BDD framework actual test cases can be converted in to feature files and should be placed in test/java - intented feature folder.
Steps needs to implemented by using the existing step definations class or new class(Must extend DriverFactory class).

Runner class-
Runner class is already present in the framework but another can be created on demand by changing features parameter.
New runner class must extend AbstractTestNGCucumberTests in order to execute it from textng.xml
New runner class must import io.cucumber.testng.CucumberOptions.
testng.xml <classes> needs to updated in case of new runner file

DriverFactory.java-
finally block needs to be updated in case of any futher addition to seleniumBase package


Execution from command line needs below steps
---------------------------
*Surefire plugins are implemented in pom.xml to leverage execution from command prompt.
Steps - 1) Point the execution directory same as the location of pom.xml file
	2) pom.xml will target the testNG.xml file which contains the runner class
		
*Application URL, browser type is defined in config.properties file and values of them can be modified on demand

*Parallel execution implemented in testng.xml with thread count as 2.

*Cucumber default report encorporated to capture test result and screenshot incase of failure.
